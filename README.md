## 🎯 Side Project: [overbuilt.space](https://overbuilt.space)

> A satire on over-engineering, born from seeing both sides of the complexity coin

After years of building both startup MVPs and enterprise systems, I created overbuilt.space as a playful exploration of software architecture. It's an educational satire project where I intentionally over-engineer simple programming problems to demonstrate enterprise patterns.

Why? Because sometimes the best way to understand when to use complex architecture is to see it used where it's absolutely not needed. Each project serves as both entertainment and a learning resource for developers exploring enterprise patterns.

```typescript
// The overbuilt.space philosophy
if (canBeSolvedWithOneService) {
  useMultipleMicroservices();
  addEventSourcing();
  implementCQRS();
  // Because why not?
  addBlockchain();
}
```

## 💡 Engineering Philosophy

- Build scalable solutions for real-world problems
- Balance technical excellence with practical implementation
- Learn continuously and share knowledge
- Keep a sense of humor about our craft
